BarberPole is a little class, that shows this little spinning barber pole, you probably know from Net+ or the Tracker.

This is V1.0 and should compile on both x86 and PPC, although I currently haven't tested it on PPC. If you want to set the color of the pole, do it by using 

myBarberPol->SetHighColor(...) 
	and 
myBarberPole->SetLowColor(...)

BarberPole is Freeware. If you made any changes, please report it to me, so I could update it.
